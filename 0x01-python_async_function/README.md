Asynchronous Python Tasks
This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating the use of asynchronous programming concepts in Python. Each script corresponds to a specific task focusing on asynchronous coroutines and tasks.

Tasks Overview
The Basics of Async

Write an asynchronous coroutine wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay seconds and returns it.
Execute Multiple Coroutines Concurrently

Implement an async routine wait_n that spawns wait_random n times with the specified max_delay, returning a list of all the delays.
Measure the Runtime

Create a measure_time function to measure the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay) and return the average time per task.
Tasks

Implement a function task_wait_random that returns an asyncio.Task for the wait_random coroutine.
Alter the wait_n code into a new function task_wait_n to use task_wait_random instead of wait_random.
File Structure
0-basic_async_syntax.py: Contains the implementation of the wait_random coroutine.
1-concurrent_coroutines.py: Implements the wait_n function to execute multiple coroutines concurrently.
2-measure_runtime.py: Measures the runtime of wait_n execution.
3-tasks.py: Implements the task_wait_random function to return an asyncio.Task.
4-tasks.py: Alters the wait_n code to create task_wait_n for using task_wait_random.
Usage
Each script can be executed directly to test its functionality. For example:


python3 0-basic_async_syntax.py
Dependencies
These scripts require Python 3.x and the asyncio module.
