Python Variable Annotations
This repository contains Python scripts with variable annotations.

Tasks
0. Basic annotations - add
Filename: 0-add.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function add that takes two float arguments a and b, and returns their sum as a float.
1. Basic annotations - concat
Filename: 1-concat.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function concat that takes two string arguments str1 and str2, and returns their concatenated string.
2. Basic annotations - floor
Filename: 2-floor.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function floor that takes a float argument n and returns its floor as an int.
3. Basic annotations - to string
Filename: 3-to_str.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float argument n and returns its string representation.
4. Define variables
Filename: 4-define_variables.py
Description: Define and annotate variables a, pi, i_understand_annotations, and school with specified values.
5. Complex types - list of floats
Filename: 5-sum_list.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.
6. Complex types - mixed list
Filename: 6-sum_mixed_list.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
Filename: 7-to_kv.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple containing k and the square of v as a float.
8. Complex types - functions
Filename: 8-make_multiplier.py
Description: Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.
9. Let's duck type an iterable object
Filename: 9-element_length.py
Description: Annotate the function element_length's parameters and return values with the appropriate types.
10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence
Filename: 100-safe_first_element.py
Description: Augment the function safe_first_element with correct duck-typed annotations.
11. More involved type annotations
Filename: 101-safely_get_value.py
Description: Add type annotations to the function safely_get_value given its parameters and return values.
12. Type Checking
Filename: 102-type_checking.py
Description: Use mypy to validate the code in 102-type_checking.py and apply any necessary changes.
