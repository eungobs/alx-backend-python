# 0x02-python_async_comprehension

## Description

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, specifically using async generators, async comprehensions, and measuring runtime for parallel comprehensions. Asynchronous programming allows for concurrent execution of tasks, which can improve performance and responsiveness in certain scenarios, particularly in I/O-bound operations.

## Task Overview

### Task 0: Async Generator

In this task, I am required to write a coroutine called `async_generator` that loops 10 times, asynchronously waits for 1 second each time, and yields a random number between 0 and 10 using the `random` module.

### Task 1: Async Comprehensions

For this task, I need to import `async_generator` from the previous task and write a coroutine called `async_comprehension`. This coroutine should collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehension over `async_generator` and then return these 10 random numbers.

### Task 2: Run Time for Four Parallel Comprehensions

In this task, I will import `async_comprehension` from the previous file and write a coroutine called `measure_runtime`. The goal is to execute `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather` and measure the total runtime.

## How to Solve

1. Start by implementing the `async_generator` coroutine. Use asynchronous programming concepts and the `asyncio` module to handle asynchronous waiting and yielding of random numbers.
   
2. Once `async_generator` is implemented, proceed to implement the `async_comprehension` coroutine. Utilize async comprehensions to collect random numbers generated by `async_generator` asynchronously.

3. For the final task, `measure_runtime`, import `async_comprehension` and use `asyncio.gather` to execute it four times concurrently. Measure the total runtime using appropriate methods provided by the `asyncio` module.

4. Ensure that my code adheres to the provided requirements, including proper documentation, type annotations, code style, and file structure.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x02-python_async_comprehension.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd 0x02-python_async_comprehension

3. Implement each task following the provided instructions.

4. Test your implementations by running the provided test scripts or creating your own test scripts.

5. Ensure that my code meets all requirements mentioned in the README.md file and the project description.

6. After completing the tasks, I can submit my solutions for review and evaluation.
